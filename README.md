___ Dot Matrix Animation Composer

Dot matrix composer can be used to generate binary arrays for LED dot matrix displays. It gives a visual and interactive interface to overcome the cumbersome process of programming these displays manually. This version currently supports:

- Bit shifting (left, right, up, down)
- Animation (frame creation, duplication, deletion, framerate selection)
- Arrow key navigation (frame navigation, play/pause)
- Source code compiler (generates C binary array)
- Load/Save animation
